The below is email subject and body I have recieved.
Can you help me generate reply to it.

If additional information is needed for an email:
	1.Check AzureAISearchPlugin (textSearch plugin) for the required information and use if found here.
	2.If not found, check in get_all_emails kernel function and use if found here.
	3.If still not found, use BingPlugin to search the internet.
	4.Incorporate the found information into the email as needed.
